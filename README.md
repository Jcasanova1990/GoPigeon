# Go Pigeon

Go Pigeon is a simple yet challenging arcade game where players control a small bird, guiding it through narrow gaps between buildings. The bird flaps its wings with each tap, requiring precise timing to avoid obstacles and stay airborne. The goal is to survive as long as possible while scoring points for each building successfully passed. With its retro pixel-art style and addictive gameplay, Go Pigeon tests playersâ€™ reflexes and patience in a fun and frustrating way!
